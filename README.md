Improvements
============
There are a number of ways this can be improved:
- Validation - Ensure all inputs are numeric / integers where appropriate
- Exceptions - Better error handling for divide by zero and other validation issues
- Arithmetic Typecast left open to allow for float and integers. Investigate better way to do this to include input and output casting.
- Frontend Error Responses
- Investigate a Single "Calculate" Interface and single "calculate" Endpoint for a large code reduction.
